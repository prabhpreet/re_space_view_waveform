## Features
- Components for discrete data and event markers, and archetype for waveform plot
- Time aligned viewer for multiple waveforms, separated by first level entity path
- Secondary marker, and time delta between markers
- Preview of values on right, with linearly interpolated analog samples
- Selected waveforms can be viewed separately in selected mode

## Possible future items

- [ ] Merge upstream with timeseries space view
- [ ] Overrides, fallback
- [ ] Single, simplifed egui plot widget supported analog, discrete and event markers, with resizable side pane
